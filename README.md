2. Tasks
   * Assembler
      * Test the assembler with driver code
   * Executor
      * Registers file
      * Stack pointer, stack logic and return
      * Negative numbers
      * Program Counter (PC): Manage a program counter to keep track of the current instruction being executed.
      * Memory Model: Implement a simple memory model to load and store data. This can be an array representing RAM.
      * Every executed file has a state file that consists of registers values and memory
      * State file at the end of execution
      * Handle Exceptions
