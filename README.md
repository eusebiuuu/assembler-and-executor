# Assembler-and-executor

1. Tasks
   * Executor
      * Test the assembler: each instruction, all possible cases
      * Test the interpreter: each instruction, all possible cases
      * State file at the end of execution: registers and stack
   * Testing
      * Project structure refactoring
      * Complete the asm programs (add printf and scanf) & remove the drivers
      * Define commands to test the programs (assemble and execute the statements)
      * Test the emulator with various inputs
   * Improvements
      * Improve the parser and the interpreter for more general uses & handle exceptions
      * Create a lexer
      * Brainstorm other ideas
      * Explore other projects
