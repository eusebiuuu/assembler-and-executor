# Assembler-and-executor

1. Tasks
   * Executor
      * Execute the instructions: call functions and stack update, stack workflow - sp register, access variables
      * Jump to last label from global directive at the start of the program
      * Initial state file: remove drivers, registers (read them), stack
      * State file at the end of execution: registers, stack
   * Testing
      * Define commands to concatenate, assemble and execute the statements
      * Test the assembler
   * Improvements
      * Handle exceptions in executor
      * Create a better parser
